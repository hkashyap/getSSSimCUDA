# getSSSimCUDA
CUDA C implementation of getSSSim gene coexpression similarity measure

# Tested using:
Platform: Ubuntu 14.04, gcc 4.8.4, CUDA 7.5

Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980

# To use:
1. The provided Makefile compiles the allGenes.cu, which is the main CUDA implmentation of getSSSim
2. For users without a GPU, we also provide a non cuda implementation of getSSSim, which is still compiles using nvcc, as it uses some functions from the CUDA library for storekeeping. Can be converted to use standard C library functions to compile uisng GCC alone (without CUDA API).
3. We also provide the version of the getSSSim used in our 2016 Nature Scientific Reports paper.
