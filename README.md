# getSSSimCUDA
CUDA C implementation of getSSSim gene coexpression similarity measure

# Tested using:
Platform: Ubuntu 16.04, gcc 5.4.0, CUDA 7.5

Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980

# To use:
1. The provided Makefile compiles the allGenes.cu, which is the main CUDA implmentation of getSSSim
2. For users without a GPU, we also provide a CPU only implementation of getSSSim. You can compile it using g++ (without CUDA API).
3. Additionally, we provide the version of the getSSSim used in our 2016 Nature Scientific Reports paper.
